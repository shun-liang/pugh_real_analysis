    "### Definition: Single set\n",
    "\n",
    "A **singleton set** is a set that has exactly one member.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation note: $\\subset$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book $A \\subset B$ means $A$ is a subset of $B$. While in some other literature $A \\subset B$ denotes $A$ is a *proper subset* of $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus in this book $A \\subset A$ is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition: Disjoint sets\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, then $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition: Symmetric difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The **symmetric difference** of $A$ and $B$ is the set $A \\triangle B$ each of whose elements belongs to $A$ but not to $B$, or belongs to $B$ but not to $A$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition: Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a collection of sets. The sets are members of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could consider the class $\\varepsilon$ of sets of even natural numbers. Then\n",
    "- $\\{2, 15\\}$ is not a member of $\\varepsilon$.\n",
    "- $\\{6\\}$ is a member of $\\varepsilon$.\n",
    "- $\\emptyset$ is a member of $\\varepsilon$ as each element of the empty set is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "If each member of class $A$ is also a member of class $B$, then we call $A$ is a **subclass** of $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the class $\\tau$ of sets positive integers divisible by $10$. Then $\\tau$ is a subclass of $\\varepsilon$, and we write $\\tau \\subset \\varepsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example, let $\\mathscr{S}$ be the class of singleton subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$, and $\\mathbb{D}$ be the class of subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ each of which has exactly two elements. Thus $\\{10\\} \\in \\mathscr{S}$, and $\\{2, 6\\} \\in \\mathscr{D}$. By definition, $\\mathscr{S}$ is not a subclass of $\\mathbb{D}$. However, for each member of $\\mathscr{S}$, there exist member of $\\mathbb{D}$ which the former member is the subset of the latter member.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equivalence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition: Equivalence relation\n",
    "\n",
    "An **equivalence relation** on a set $S$ is a relation $s \\sim s^\\prime$ that holdes three properties: For all $s, s^\\prime, s^{\\prime\\prime} \\in S$:\n",
    "- (a) Reflexitivity: $s \\sim s$.\n",
    "- (b) Symmetricity: $s \\sim s^\\prime \\implies s^\\prime \\sim s$.\n",
    "- (c) Translativity: $(s \\sim s^\\prime) \\land (s^\\prime \\sim s^{\\prime\\prime}) \\implies s \\sim s^{\\prime\\prime}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equivalence relation breaking a set into equivalence classes\n",
    "\n",
    "![](equivalence_classes_and_representatives.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 shows how the equivalence relation breaks S into disjoint subsets called **equivalence classes**$^â€ $ defined by mutual equivalence: The equivalence class containing $s$ consists of all elements $s^\\prime \\in S$ equivalent to $s$ and is denoted $[s]$. The element $s$ is a **representative** of its equivalence class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think again of citizens and countries. Say two citizens are equivalent if they are citizens of the same country. The world of equivalence relations is egalitarian: I represent my equivalence class USA just as much as does the president.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "When is a mathematical statement accepted as true?\n",
    "\n",
    "Things help mathematical statements being accepted as true:\n",
    "- A picture may be vital in getting you to believe a statement.\n",
    "- An analogy with something you know to be true may help you understand it.\n",
    "- ~An authoritative teacher may force you to parrot it.~\n",
    "\n",
    "A more mathematical answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Only when it has a proof inside a familiar mathematical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "A formal proof is the ultimate and only reason to accept a mathematical statement as true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From Bob Osserman:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...a convincing argument is not a proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...Critics point out that standards of rigor change from century to century."
